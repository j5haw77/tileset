# Tahoe tileset
This tileset gives a touch of color to the Lake Tahoe region, based off the "Outdoors" basemap from Mapbox. This area, my hometown, is a beautiful part of the world, and needs a touch of color to be truly expressed in a map. I chose the zoom levels of 9-12 because it captures the greater Tahoe region, as well as allowing for some closer detail.
